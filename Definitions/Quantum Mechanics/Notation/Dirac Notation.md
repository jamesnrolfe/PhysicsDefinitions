Use the notation $\ket{\psi}$ for complex vectors. In a two-dimensional [[Hilbert space]] with basis $\{ \ket{0}, \ket{1} \}$ e.g. 
$$
\ket{\psi} = \begin{pmatrix}
\alpha \\
\beta
\end{pmatrix} =\alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1} 
$$
where $\alpha^{2} + \beta^{2}=1$ for normalisation.

We can also call this 'bra-ket' notation. Above was a **ket**, a **bra** exists as
$$
\bra{\psi} = \begin{pmatrix}
\alpha & \beta
\end{pmatrix} = \alpha \bra{0} +\beta \bra{1} 
$$
where again $\alpha^{2}+\beta^{2}=1$ for normalisation.
