  - Pauli exclusion principle
---

The Pauli exclusion principle is a fundamental quantum mechanical principle proposed by Wolfgang Pauli in 1925. It states that no two identical fermions (particles with half-integer spin, such as electrons) can occupy the exact same quantum state simultaneously in a quantum system.

This implies that:
- In an atom, no two electrons can have the same set of quantum numbers
- This principle explains the electron configuration of atoms
- It determines the chemical properties of elements
- Prevents electrons from collapsing into the lowest energy state in an atom

Mathematically, this means the wave function for a system of fermions must be antisymmetric under particle exchange. For electrons in an atom, this results in:
- Each electron must have a unique combination of quantum numbers (n, l, ml, ms)
- Maximum of two electrons per atomic orbital (with opposite spins)
