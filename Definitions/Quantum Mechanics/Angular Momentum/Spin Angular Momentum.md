The spin of a particle is an **intrinsic** property of that particle - much like **mass** or **charge**. 
It is often thought of as the particle "spinning" on its axis - but this is incorrect (electrons are thought to be point particles for example, and so have no axis to spin on). It is however related to angular momentum. It suggests that particles have some inherent angular momentum, even when *not physically rotating*.

Spin can take **integer** or **half-integer** values, depending on the type of particle.

The **spin angular momentum** has most of the same properties as [[Orbital Angular Momentum|orbital angular momentum]], but also some *special* properties.

We will write $\hat{S}$ for spin in place of $\hat{L}$ in [[Orbital Angular Momentum|orbital angular momentum]]. We can still use the eigenstates of $\hat{S}^z$ and $\vec{S}^2$ with the same quantum numbers $\ell$ and $m$, such that $$\begin{align} \hat{S}^2  \ket{\ell, m} &=m\hbar \ket{\ell, m} \\\vec{S}^2 \ket{\ell, m} &= \ell(\ell+1)\hbar^2\ket{\ell, m} 
 \end{align}$$ as before.

Clearly, the spin eigenstate $\ket{\ell, m}$ behaves here just like the [[Orbital Angular Momentum|orbital]] eigenstate $Y_{\ell, m}$, but there are *two fundamental differences*:
1. $\ket{\ell, m}$ does not have an explicit form in terms of $\theta$ and $\phi$ like $Y_{\ell, m}$. 
2. $\ell$ may now be an integer, as before, *or* a **half-integer**.
The values of $m$ still differ by unity and still take all the values between $-\ell$ and ${} +\ell$, but if $\ell$ is an integer $+\frac{1}{2}$ then so are the $m$. For example:
- If $\ell= \frac{3}{2}$ then the possible values of $m$ are $- \frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}$.
- If $\ell=\frac{1}{2}$ then $m$ can be $-\frac{1}{2}$ or $\frac{1}{2}$.
