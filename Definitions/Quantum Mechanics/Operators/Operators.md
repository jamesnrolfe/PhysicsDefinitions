Operators are objects that act on states to give states (either the same state, or a different one). 

In finite dimensional [[Hilbert Space|Hilbert spaces]] these are simply matrices acting on vectors to give vectors.

In infinite dimensional [[Hilbert Space|Hilbert spaces]] they can be differential operators acting on functions to give functions.
