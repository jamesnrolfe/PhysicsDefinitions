  - Néel temperature
---
The **Néel Temperature** is the temperature above which a [[Anti-ferromagnetism|anti-ferromagnet]] will become a [[paramagnet]]. In other words, the alignment of [[Magnetic Moment|magnetic moments]] of the atoms in the material will become disordered.

The Néel temperature is usually denoted $T_{N}$.

> See [[Curie Temperature]] for the case with [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnets]].
