  - Néel temperature
---
The **Néel Temperature** is the temperature above which a [[Anti-ferromagnetism|anti-ferromagnet]] will become a [[paramagnet]]. In other words, the alignment of [[Magnetic Moment|magnetic moments]] of the atoms in the material will become disordered.

The Néel temperature is usually denoted $T_{N}$.

*Magnetisation of an anti-ferromagnet as a function of temperature. Note the drop to zero at the Néel temperature $T_{N}$. Compared to the graph of the [[Curie Temperature]] for ferromagnets, there is no overall net magnetisation, as we would expect for ferromagnets.*

> See [[Curie Temperature]] for the case with [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnets]].
