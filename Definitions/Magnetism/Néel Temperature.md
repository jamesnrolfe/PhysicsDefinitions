  - Néel temperature

The **Néel Temperature** is the temperature above which a [[Anti-ferromagnetism|anti-ferromagnet]] will become a [[paramagnet]]. In other words, the alignment of [[Magnetic Moment|magnetic moments]] of the atoms in the material will become disordered.

The Néel temperature is usually denoted $T_{N}$.
