An anti-ferromagnet is a type of magnetic material where the [[Magnetic Moment|magnetic moments]] of atoms or ions are aligned in **opposite** directions (as opposed to [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetism]], in which the align in the same direction), effectively *canceling out the net magnetic field*. 

In this arrangement, adjacent atomic [[Magnetic Moment|magnetic moments]] point in **exactly** opposite directions

The magnetic ordering occurs *below* a specific temperature called the **NÃ©el temperature**.
