**Bosons** are subatomic particles that follow **Bose-Einstein statistics** and have **integer** spin values. They are one of the *two* fundamental classes of particles in quantum mechanics, with the other being [[Fermions|fermions]]. Bosons can be **force-carrying**.

They can occupy the same quantum state *simultaneously*.

There are a few types of **bosons**.

1. **Force-Carrying Bosons**
   - Photons (electromagnetic force)
   - Gluons (strong nuclear force)
   - W and Z bosons (weak nuclear force)
   - Gravitons (hypothetical gravity carrier)

2. **Composite Bosons**
   - Helium-4 atoms
   - Cooper pairs in superconductors
   - Some atomic nuclei with even numbers of protons and neutrons

3. **Higgs Boson**
   - Discovered in 2012
   - Gives mass to other fundamental particles
   - Critical to the Standard Model of particle physics
