Classically, we think of angular momentum $\vec{L}$ as being given by 
$$
\vec{L}=\vec{r} \times \vec{p}
$$
where $\vec{r}$ is the **position vector** of the particle, and $\vec{p}$ is the **momentum vector**. In quantum mechanics, the equation looks *exactly the same*:
$$
\hat{L}=\hat{r} \times \hat{p}
$$
where we now use the [[Operators|operator]] form instead. This causes the
