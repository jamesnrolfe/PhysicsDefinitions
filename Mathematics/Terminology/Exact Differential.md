An exact differential is a differential $df$ of a function $f(x, y, ...)$ that can be written as $df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} dx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} dy + ...$. A differential $M(x, y) dx + N(x, y) dy$ is exact if and only if $\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$.
