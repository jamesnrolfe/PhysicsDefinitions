A magnetic moment is a physical quantity that describes the strength and orientation of a magnetic dipole. Fundamentally, it represents the torque experienced by a magnetic dipole in an external magnetic field.

It can be thought of indicating the magnetic dipole's tendency to align with an applied magnetic field

In quantum mechanics, the magnetic moment is fundamental to explaining the behaviour of particles in magnetic fields and their intrinsic angular momentum (spin).

The magnetic moment is generally measured in units of $\text{Am}^2$ or $J / T$.
