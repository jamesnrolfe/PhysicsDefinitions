An interesting feature of [[Anti-ferromagnetism|anti-ferromagnets]] is the possibility of **frustration**, which occurs when systems contain **nearest-neighbour** paths with odd numbers of atoms. The simplest example is a cluster of three atoms, each of which is a nearest neighbour to both of the others. Since the antiferromagnetic exchange favours antiparallel alignment of the others, then this is not possible for all three of the atoms at the same time, so we use the term **frustration** to describe this interaction.
