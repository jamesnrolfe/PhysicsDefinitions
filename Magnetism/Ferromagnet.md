A ferromagnet is a material that can be magnetised to become a permanent magnet, with magnetic domains that align in the same direction when exposed to an external magnetic field. They exhibit spontaneous magnetisation.

Common examples of ferromagnetic materials include Iron and Nickel.

The magnetic properties arise from the alignment of electron spins in specific crystal structures, creating magnetic domains that can be easily magnetised. This makes ferromagnets crucial in many technological applications.

At high temperatures (called the **Curie temperature**), ferromagnetic materials lose their magnetic properties and become paramagnetic, where they only weakly respond to magnetic fields.
